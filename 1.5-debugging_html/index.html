<p>What causes errors in HTML?</p>

<ul>
    <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed</strong> properly, then its effect can spread to areas
        you didn't intend
    </li>

    <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly.
        <strong><em>strong emphasised? what is this?</em></strong></li>

    <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example: <a
            href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozilla homepage</a></li>
</ul>
